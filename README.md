# crotbank-webapp

Banking web application built with plain JavaScript

Deployed site: https://crotbank-webapp.netlify.app/

To be able to fully test the functionality of this application, formal login details are required. User 1: {username: 'ac', password: 1111}. User 2: {username: 'jk', password: 2222}.

The main impetus for creating this project was the opportunity to test many of the popular array methods that developers use every day. By logging in with one of the accounts, we can send money to another (by nickname), simulate a loan request, or permanently close account by re-entering the login info.
There is also an imitation of a security system that creates a timer and, after the time expires, throws the user to the main banking screen.
